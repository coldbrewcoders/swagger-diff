Basics:

* Finish Writing Diff algorithm to detect notable changes
* Finish Model Class that holds all information needed to create a diff report, populate new instance during diff algorithm
* Write method on reporting class that Outputs JSON formatted for slack message
* Add method to Client Request service that send a client request to the slack webhook
* Write dockerfile to containerize app
* Publish on docker-hub
* Set up at work


Extras:

* If a web-service fails to get initial json file on startup, have webhook simply attempt to fetch and store document instead of performing diff
* Create proper error handling and logging in case of unexpected scenarios
* Allow for specific API version for each web-service
* Write unit tests for services (figure out framework and strategy)


Docker:
* Figure out what the unknown docker params in the commented section of docker file mean

* Create CBC Docker Hub Account
* Add container to CBC Docker Hub account
